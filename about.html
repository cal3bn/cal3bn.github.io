  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>I'm Caleb Neal, an IT student at Sinclair Community College. I plan on advancing to the University of Cincinnati for a degree in CyberSecurity/Cryptography. This website was a project to test my HTML5+CSS abilities.
  I've been surrounded and enamored by computers since before I can remember, and when I was as young as a third-grader teachers were calling me out of classes to troubleshoot basic computer issues. In High School I joined
  the USA CyberPatriot competition and gained experience in real-time threat analysis and prevention. In college I've joined the Sinclair Cyber Team and we've been gaining pentesting and technical writeup experience.
  In addition, I've played around with TryHackMe, DVWA (Insecure webapp), and some personal virtual machine setups to gain hands-on experience.
  
  </p>
  <h3>Experience</h3>
  <p>Although I'm still in college, I have some experience with penetration testing, security analysis, coding, and Windows/MacOS/Linux Troubleshooting. In addition, I have basic PFSense experience and training in networking.
  I love learning about all things technology and challenging myself with new projects. To quote Nikola Tesla: </p><p style="style: italic;">"I do not think there is any thrill that can go through the human heart like that felt by
  the inventor as he sees some creation of the brain unfolding to success."</p>
  <h3>Contact:</h3>

  <br/>
    <p>This site was a passion project done in a day (10/18/21) and hasn't yet been optimized for mobile but I plan to streamline it using "@media" CSS controls in the near future. </p>
